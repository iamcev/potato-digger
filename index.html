    <h1>POTATO DIGGER!!!</h1>

    <div id="game"></div>

    <p>How to play: This is minesweeper. If you know how to play minesweeper, 
        play this like you would play minesweeper. <br>
        Controls:
        <ul>
            <li>Left click: dig</li>
            <li>Right click: mark</li>
        </ul>
        Goal: Dig up all the potatoes and don't hit the ducks! <br> <br>
        Start by digging anywhere you want. Tiles will appear. <br> <br>
        The number on a tile stands for how many ducks there are adjacent to it.
        If there is no number, good for you! The tile has no ducks next to it. <br> <br>
        Try to use the numbers to deduce where the ducks are. 
        If you think that a tile has a duck, mark them by right clicking the tile. <br> <br>
        Once you clear out all the tiles without hitting any ducks, you win!
